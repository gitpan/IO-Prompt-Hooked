    - Fixed a test in 20-logic.t that was generating warnings under 
      Perl 5.8.x.
    - Took a closer look at Perl::Critic advice (made a couple of 
      minor changes).
    - Removed Capture::Tiny dependency from t/20-logic.t (it wasn't
      being used there anyway).
    - Added Capture::Tiny dependency to BUILD_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL
      for 30-io_prompt_tiny.t.

      the tests.
