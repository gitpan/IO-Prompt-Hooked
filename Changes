    - Set default number of tries if tries isn't already set to a positive
      number in non-interactive mode.  This fixes the endless loop condition
      that could occur if default fails to validate in non-interactive mode.
    - Tests now manage interactive mode detection more directly.
    - POD now explains new "tries" bevavior in non-interactive mode.
    - Param validation simplified.
    - Devel::Cover now reports 100% coverage.
    - Set minimum Perl version to 5.6.0.

    - Changed how _is_interactive() is imported into module (tracking
      down an elusive *BSD test suite FAIL).
    - Added several tests to t/20-logic.t to try to track down the bug.
    - Tests added to bring coverage to 96.9%.

    - Fixed a test in 20-logic.t that was generating warnings under 
      Perl 5.8.x.
    - Took a closer look at Perl::Critic advice (made a couple of 
      minor changes).
    - Removed Capture::Tiny dependency from t/20-logic.t (it wasn't
      being used there anyway).
    - Added Capture::Tiny dependency to BUILD_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL
      for 30-io_prompt_tiny.t.

    - Localized and unset the PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT in two tests where
      smoke testers might have been running with it set, thus breaking
      the tests.
